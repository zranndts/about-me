Welcome to my lil' repo 🌱  
This is literally just me testing how GitHub works (yaay first commit 🎉)

## About Me

Hi! I'm currently a 2nd-semester Informatics student who's into coding, debugging weird errors,  
and sometimes creating overly dramatic dialog trees for my text-based games (don’t judge pls 😂)

Lately I’ve been exploring:
- Python (my comfort language 🐍)
- SQL (trying to understand all those joins)
- C++ (feels like understanding how magic works under the hood)

---

## What’s this repo?

This one’s just me practicing how to:
- Create a repo
- Write a README
- Make a commit (and hopefully light up my first green square 🟩)

No big deal, but feels exciting anyway.

## P.S.

One day I’ll flood this place with my chaotic projects,  
but for now... baby steps 😌✨
